# Resources 
This will be a location for links of useful information I have found that 
has helped me with issues, questions or just curiosities.  I am still trying to figure out the best structure - I understand its not the clearest at the moment. Bare with me - WIP.

# Websites
I will include a quick scenario for which each link has helped me.

## W1 Backup Options
https://www.howtogeek.com/427480/how-to-back-up-your-linux-system/

I had a corrupted motherboard. It could
not hold the Windows OS (think blue 
screen of death). I scrapped that for
Ubuntu, and it crashed about 8 times 
in the span of one month. It was the 
stable build. Now that I have a new 
machine, I want to not have to continue
to download all the configurations I made.
I was not able to perform it via rsync
but I did use grsync. 



## W2 Password Management
I most often use KDBX file types for 
password storage such as 
[Macpass](https://macpassapp.org) for Mac OS
& [Keeweb](https://keepass.info/download.html) for Linux/Windows OS.

A shared/local & individual & within the 
terminal you can use:

The tutorial I used is:
