## What is it?
VS code is a free open-source code editor 
that is available for all major platforms. I 
was attempting to run Git in a more 
traditional fashion with the command line but
I found it hard to find a spell checker for
vim. ***IF you're reading this, please feel
free to drop tips on how to do this, also 
taking a mental note to find my own solution.***

In the interim, I am using VS code downloaded
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). 

What I have learned is that you can use VS 
code to write in several languages with a 
nice UX. There is a built in terminal & you 
can connect it to your GitHub. 

## How to Connect GitHub<->VS Code 
Once downloaded, on the left hand side you 
will see a gear icon. From there you will see
the option to connect a GitHub account,
additionally you will can clone the repository using the Source Control icon.


**Will add more to this once I have the proper images.**
