## Network Introduction

A *network* is nothing two or more computers connected by a cable or a wireless radio connection so that they can exchange information. These computers are normally connected by a wire that's on a switch, the switch is normally connected to a patch panel in small and big businesses. Networks are designed to share files, resources and programs.

*LAN* stands for local area network.
*WAN* stands for wide area network.
*MAN* stands for metropolitan area network.

The network that contains the hard drives printers and other resources that are shared with network computers is a *server*. Any computer that is not a server is a client. 

A *node* is a device that's connected to the network. A node is the same as a computer.

A *packet* is a message that is sent over the network from one node to another node. The packet includes the address of the node that sent the packet. 

### Networking 
The internet protocol (IP) defines the format of IP addresses: four eight-bit numbers called octets who's decimal values rage from 0 to 255. 

| Layers           | Definition                                                                                                      |   |   |   |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|---|---|
| Physical  (1)    | mechanical & electrical details of network components, this includes cables, connectors and network interfaces. |   |   |   |
| Data link (2)    | how devices are identified on the network, typically MAC addresses. Switches operate at this layer.             |   |   |   |
| Network (3)      | handles the routing of data across networks. Routers operate here.                                              |   |   |   |
| Transport (4)    | provides the reliable delivery of packets.                                                                      |   |   |   |
| Session (5)      | establishes sessions between network applications.                                                              |   |   |   |
| Presentation (6) | converts data so that systems that use different data formats can exchange information.                         |   |   |   |
| Application (7)  | allows applications to request network services.                                                                |   |   |   |
