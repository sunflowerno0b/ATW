# Things-Learned
I'm on a journey to learn about things like, but not limited to:

* Linux
* DevOps 
* SysAdmin 
* InFoSec & more.

On this journey, I have found it super hard to understand things sometimes-
if not all the time. The tech community has a tendency to write things in a way that assumes the reader is at a certain knowledge level, usually within the moderate to proficient tiers. 

This digital garden will double as not only my notes to reference but as a place for you; if you too find yourself in new territory, hopefully this space can help. 

I can only cover what I am exposed to, if there is something you would like to work on together, please let me know.
