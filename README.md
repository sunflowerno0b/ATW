# Things-Learned
I'm on a journey to learn all things Linux, DevOps, SysAdmin, Security, InFoSec & more. On this journey, I have found it super hard to understand things sometimes-
if not all the time. The tech community has a tendency to write things in a way that assumes the reader is at a certain level, usually moderate to proficient. 
This repo will double as not only my notes (to reference at any time in my lifetime) but as a place for you, if you too find yourself in new territory hopefully
this will help. I can only cover what I am exposed to, if there is something you would like to work on together, please let me know- I am happy and eager to learn!
